Git and Github bootcamp Day - 1 - Getting started with git terminal and basic commands

1) To check whether git is installed in your systems or not and its version -:
	git --version
	
2) Configuring your username and email-:
	git config --global user.name "your_username"
	git config --global user.email "your_email"
	
3) Fork the repository

4) Creating a directory, moving to that working directory and using basic commands like mkdir, cd, pwd etc.

5) Cloning the repository-:
	git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
	
6) Creating a branch-:
	git branch name_of_branch
	
7) Checking the branches present-:
	git branch

8) Moving onto the branch for working-:
	git checkout name_of_branch
	
9) Do the modifications to the project and do things that you want to accomplish, then check the status of work by the following command-:
	git status
	
10) Now we'll move onto the staging area, it's basically an intermediate stage that tells Git that we want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit, but it doesn't affect the repository until we commit-:
	git add -A
	
11) Now we'll check the status once more to see the changes-:
	git status
	
12) Now we'll commit our changes to our repository-:
	git commit -m "message"
	
13) Now final check of the changes we made to our repository before we push the changes to the master repository-:
	git push origin new-branch

Note - To push your hanges directly into the master branch we write the command-:
	git push origin -u master
